I wrote with a friend this booklet for [Competence Micro](http://competencemicro.com/booklet.php?id=232) back in 2011 about HTML5 and CSS3. It is still available on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.fr/HTML5-CSS3-Collectif/dp/235564067) even if it is no longer up to date.

This is an old website which go with it you can wiew it [here](http://antoinebrisseau.com/html5-css3/).
